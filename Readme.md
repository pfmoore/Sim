Sim - A game simulator
======================

This program is a proof of concept implementation in Java of a Monte Carlo
simulator of die rolls and similar game mechanics. It is based on the ideas
behind a much more complete program, Monaco, written by Chris Dearlove.

Example usage:
```
java -cp "externals/*;/Utils/Groovy/embeddable/groovy-all-2.4.4.jar;out/production/Sim" uk.org.enk.Sim --samples 122 -f expr.groovy
```
